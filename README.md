# Notes for M5Stack Beginners

- To implement in C++, use the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
- To implement in MicroPython, use UiFlow.
- To implement in JavaScript, use the Moddable SDK or Espruino.
- Developing in C++ from scratch is quite tedious, so you'll generally need to use some kind of firmware.
- Once you've developed something from scratch, it's implemented in assistant/assistant.ino.

You can refer to the official documentation here: [https://github.com/m5stack/M5Stack/blob/master/docs/getting_started_ja.md]
